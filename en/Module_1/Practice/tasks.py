Practice

Task 1:
Store any 3 numbers

Task 2:
Split words in string by spaces (From "Hello there" create ["Hello", "there"])

Task 3:
Count number of times `c` letter occurs in string

Task 4:
Find position of `y` sign in this string
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Task 5:
Take 3 numbers: A, B and C. Print sum of B and A in power of C.

Task 6:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age, and then calculates and prints their age
in months.

Task 7:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, and then converts and
prints the temperature in Fahrenheit.
Tip: Use this formula for conversion
`(C × 9/5) + 32 = F`
where C - temperature in Celsius and F is temperature in Fahrenheit

Task 8:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number, and then prints whether the number is even
or odd.

Task 9:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation (such as +, -, *, or /),
and then performs the specified operation on the two numbers and prints the result.
2 numbers and operator must be entered each on its line

Task 10:
Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade.
The grading scale is as follows:
A: 90 - 100
B: 80 - 89
C: 70 - 79
D: 60 - 69
F: below 60
The program should print the student's grade based on their score.

Task 11:
Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints the larger number.

Task 12:
Write a Python program that takes the radius of a circle as input from the user and computes its
area. The formula for the area of a circle is: A = pi * r^2, where pi is a constant and r is the
radius of the circle. Small tip: to use a pi constant try to import that: `from math import pi`

Task 13:
Write a program that takes a year (single number) as input from the user and prints "Leap" if the
year is leap, and "Not leap" otherwise.

Task 14:
Write a Python program that takes the coefficients of a quadratic equation as input from the user
and finds its roots. The program should print the roots rounded to two decimal places. The formula
for the roots of a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is:
x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/ 2a

Task 15:
Write a program that takes an age as input from the user and prints "Ok" if the number is greater
than 21, and "At least you can drive" if the number is between 18 and 21 and "Where's your mum?"
otherwise.

Task 16:
Write a program that takes a number as input from the user and prints day of week this number
describe. Consider Jan 1st is Monday. The number is integer and greater than 0 (up to infinity)

Task 17:
Write a program that takes a three-digit number as input from the user and prints if all its digits
are equal or not.

Task 18:
Ask the user to enter a 3-digits number, and calculate the sum of its digits. Print the result.

Task 19:
Write a program that takes 4 numbers(x1, y1, x2, y2) as input from the user and calculates number of
moves the chess queen must do for going from one cell (x1, y1) to another (x2, y2).
