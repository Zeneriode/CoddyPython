Guess the number:
There are 2 players: computer and user.
One of them minds the number from a to b (a and b are natural numbers, can be specified), and another has to guess this
number. Then they change their roles and repeat the whole process. The winner is one who makes fewer attempts to guess
the number.
Ideas to upgrade: Make functionality that players will answer like "bigger" or "smaller" that the second player can
determine the position of the guessed number

# The program

"""
Blackjack:
There are 2 players, they play one after one.
Each player takes 2 cards initially. If he wants, he can pick more cards.
The task of the players is to collect in total 21 points. If there will be at least 22 points, then the player loses
immediately. Otherwise the winner is one who picked more points.
Ideas to upgrade: increase time of execution that computer will look like a human
