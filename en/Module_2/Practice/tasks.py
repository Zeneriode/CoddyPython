Practical tasks:
Task 1:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 20.

Task 2:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

Task 3:
Write a program that uses a loop and range to print the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.

Task 4:
Write a program that uses a loop to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.

Task 5:
Write a program that uses a loop and range to print the numbers from 0 to 50 in increments of 5.

Task 6:
Write a program that uses a while loop to find the factorial of a number entered by the user.

Task 7:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th term.

Task 8:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the sum of the first 10 odd numbers.

Task 9:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three
print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are
multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Task 10:
Write a program that takes number N as a number of numbers under that and uses a loop to find the
largest number in a list of numbers entered by the user.

Task 11:
Write a program that finds the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers
entered by the user.

Task 12:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the sum of the first 10 terms of the series:
1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + ... + 10/11.

Task 13:
Write a program that takes a word from user and then prints each letter of word in each line.

Task 14:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G numbers. Print back only even numbers in reverse way.

Task 15:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G words. Print back all words in alphabetical order.

Task 16:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G strings as input and prints strings that have a length greater than 5. 

Task 17:
Write a program that takes a string and prints it reversed.

Task 18:
Write a program to count the number of vowels in a given sentence.

Task 19:
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Task 20:
Write a program that check if a given number is prime.

Task 21:
Write a program that calculates sum of digits of given number.

Task 22:
Write a program that takes a sequence of numbers and finds the mean, median and mode of these numbers.

Task 23:
You have a list of names and their ages. Create a program that takes a name as input and returns the age of the person.

Task 24:
Create a program that takes 2 lines. The first line contains some names of people and the second contains some ids of
them. Then the program has to take number G and then G lines. Each new line contain 2 numbers, the first number is the
id of parent and the second is id of child. The program must print all parents and then their children
(1 line = name of parent + name of his child)

Task 25:
You're given 2 lines of numbers. Print all numbers that exist in both lines.
