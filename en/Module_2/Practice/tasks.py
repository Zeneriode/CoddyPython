Practical tasks:
Task 1:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 20.

Task 2:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

Task 3:
Write a program that uses a loop and range to print the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.

Task 4:
Write a program that uses a loop to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.

Task 5:
Write a program that uses a loop and range to print the numbers from 0 to 50 in increments of 5.

Task 6:
Write a program that uses a while loop to find the factorial of a number entered by the user.

Task 7:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th term.

Task 8:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the sum of the first 10 odd numbers.

Task 9:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three
print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are
multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Task 10:
Write a program that takes number N as a number of numbers under that and uses a loop to find the
largest number in a list of numbers entered by the user.

Task 11:
Write a program that finds the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers
entered by the user.

Task 12:
Write a program that uses a loop to print the sum of the first 10 terms of the series:
1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + ... + 10/11.

Task 13:
Write a program that takes a word from user and then prints each letter of word in each line.

Task 14:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G numbers. Print back only even numbers in reverse way.

Task 15:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G words. Print back all words in alphabetical order.

Task 16:
Write a program that takes a number G and then G strings as input and prints strings that have a length greater than 5. 

Task 17:
Write a program that takes a string and prints it reversed.
